# Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)

Life Cycle Assessment is a systematic approach to evaluating the environmental impacts associated with all stages of a product's life.

## What is LCA?

<Info>
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a methodology for assessing environmental impacts associated with all stages of a product's life cycle, from raw material extraction through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling.
</Info>

## LCA Framework

LCA follows a structured framework defined by ISO 14040 and 14044 standards:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Goal and Scope Definition">
    Define the purpose of the assessment, system boundaries, functional unit, and impact categories.
    
    <Check>
    A clearly defined functional unit ensures fair comparison between different products or processes.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Life Cycle Inventory (LCI)">
    Collect data on all inputs (resources, energy) and outputs (emissions, waste) for each process within the system boundaries.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA)">
    Convert inventory data into potential environmental impacts across selected impact categories.
    
    <Expandable title="Common impact categories">
      - Global Warming Potential (GWP)
      - Acidification Potential
      - Eutrophication Potential
      - Ozone Depletion Potential
      - Resource Depletion
      - Water Footprint
      - Land Use
    </Expandable>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Interpretation">
    Analyze results, identify significant issues, evaluate completeness and consistency, and draw conclusions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Types of LCA

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cradle-to-Grave">
    Assesses impacts from raw material extraction through disposal/end-of-life.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Cradle-to-Gate">
    Assesses impacts from raw material extraction to the factory gate (before transportation to consumer).
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Gate-to-Gate">
    Focuses only on a specific process or manufacturing step.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Cradle-to-Cradle">
    Includes recycling and reuse processes, aiming for a closed-loop system.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Benefits of LCA

- **Holistic Assessment**: Considers multiple environmental impact categories, not just carbon emissions
- **Hotspot Identification**: Pinpoints processes with the highest environmental impacts
- **Trade-off Analysis**: Helps avoid burden shifting between different environmental impacts
- **Innovation Driver**: Guides sustainable product design and process optimization
- **Credible Communication**: Provides scientifically sound basis for environmental claims

<Warning>
While LCA is a powerful tool, results are dependent on data quality and methodological choices. Always document assumptions and limitations when interpreting LCA results.
