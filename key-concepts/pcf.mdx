# Product Carbon Footprint (PCF)

A Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) is a comprehensive measurement of greenhouse gas emissions associated with a product throughout its entire life cycle.

## What is a PCF?

<Info>
A Product Carbon Footprint quantifies the total greenhouse gas emissions generated during the entire life cycle of a product, from raw material extraction to disposal.
</Info>

PCF calculations typically include:

- Raw material extraction and processing
- Manufacturing and production
- Distribution and transportation
- Use phase
- End-of-life (disposal, recycling, or reuse)

## Calculation Methodology

PCF calculations follow standardized methodologies such as:

- ISO 14067: Greenhouse gases â€” Carbon footprint of products
- GHG Protocol Product Standard
- PAS 2050: Specification for the assessment of the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of goods and services

<Warning>
Accurate PCF calculation requires comprehensive data collection across the entire supply chain, which can be challenging but is essential for meaningful results.
